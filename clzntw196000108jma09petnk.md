### **How to Respond to a Letter of Demand**

#### **Checklist for Responding**

1. **Note the Deadline**: Contact the sender if you need an extension.
    
2. **Propose a Timeline**: Indicate when you will respond and outline your intended actions.
    
3. **Settlement Proposals**: If you opt for a settlement or installment payments, specify amounts and deadlines, marking them “without prejudice” to protect yourself.
    

#### **Detailed Steps for Responding**

1. **Acknowledge Receipt**: As soon as you receive the letter, acknowledge its receipt. This shows your willingness to engage.
    
2. **Review the Claims**: Carefully read the claims and demands made against you. Make sure you understand each point.
    
3. **Seek Legal Advice**: Consult a lawyer to help you understand your legal standing and to craft your response.
    
4. **Draft Your Response**: Based on legal advice, draft a well-structured reply. Make sure to address each demand and propose any counter-offers or settlements.
    
5. **Send Your Response**: Send your response within the specified deadline. If more time is needed, request an extension and provide a valid reason.
    
6. **Follow Up**: Keep a record of all communications and follow up to ensure your response has been received and considered.
    

By following these steps, you'll be better equipped to handle a Letter of Demand effectively, protecting your interests and potentially avoiding costly legal proceedings.
